# Skin Cancer Detection and Consultation System

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a comprehensive skin cancer detection and consultation system. The application leverages advanced NLP techniques and image analysis to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for patients concerned about skin health. Key features include an NLP chatbot, image upload and analysis, and consultation booking for high-risk predictions.

## Features

### Image Upload
- **Allows patients to upload images** of the affected skin area.
- **Supports various image formats** for user convenience.

### Patient Metadata
- **Patients can add metadata** such as age, gender, and area of localization.
- **Enhances prediction accuracy** by incorporating patient-specific details.

### Image Analysis
- **Analyzes the uploaded image** to predict the likelihood of skin cancer.
- **Uses machine learning models** trained on a diverse dataset of skin images.

### Consultation Redirect
- **Redirects patients with high-risk predictions** to a kiosk page.
- **Facilitates booking an appointment** with available doctors for further consultation.
